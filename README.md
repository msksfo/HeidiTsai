# Heidi Tsai

## Project Description

This is the website I created for Heidi Tsai, historical keyboardist based in France. I am using Gatsby as the static site generator, and Netlify for deployment. You can see the live site [here](https://heiditsai.netlify.app)

## Getting Started

- clone or download the repo
- cd into your project directory and install all project dependencies with npm install
- run npm start to start the development server
- the site is now live at http://localhost:8000
